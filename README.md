# machine-learning-car-data-analysis-with-rmd
*Practices of machine learning methods*
<br/><br/>
The purpose of this project is to learning the philosophy between cars tradings. The original data is collected from kaggle [Don't get kicked!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked), which is the same as csv files in orinigal_data folder. 
<br/><br/>
It is a practise of employing machine learning methods. The original kaggle test has already closed the evaluation access, thus there is no specific rank for this project.
<br/><br/>
In this project, data is first cleaned with preprocessing and feature selection methods, and second analyzed with multiple machine learning models, and then evaluated considering roc when applying different models.
